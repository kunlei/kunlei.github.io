I have probably spent more time revamping my personal website than actually writing contents for it.
Every once in a while, I would feel the site that I put up some time ago becomes too ugly to motivate me to update it.
Since I have gradually used more Quarto to write my books and it also has the functionality to build website, I feel it's time to yet again revamp my blog using Quarto.
Hopefully, this is the last time.
