It consists of a heuristic-driven partition engine to segment the network, a column generation-based consolidation engine that iteratively identifies cost-effective candidate loads, and a MIP-based picking engine for final load selection. Realized $1 million monthly transportation cost reductions in 2023, with progress toward replacing the current industry-leading commercial solver.\nDeveloped a rapid heuristic algorithm for solving the fixed sequence 3D bin packing problem in GDC pallet building process, addressing the 6-month learning curve and high turnover rates for new hires. Attained an average of 20s for full pallet building with 100+ heterogeneous cases, yielding 85+% packing efficiency and 80+% pallet stability. Conducted successful pilots in 2 GDCs, revealing a 70% decrease in the learning curve and an anticipated $10 million yearly savings if used across all GDCs.\nAssisted the global logistics team in selecting optimal ocean carriers and reducing total transportation costs, resulting in a cost reduction of $90 million during the challenging disruptions of the COVID-19 impacted global supply chain in fiscal year 2021.\nTech stack: Java, CPLEX, SpringBoot Microservices | Column Generation, MIP, Vehicle Routing/Bin Packing Heuristics\n\nSenior Data Scientist\n\nConceptualized and developed a profiling application prototype, enabling GDCs to attain optimal item-to-slot assignments. Participated in end-to-end system development encompassing both frontend and backend components.\nOverhauled legacy MIP-based optimization engine for optimal carrier and load quantity determination in Walmart’s ocean procurement during fiscal year 2020. Strengthened modeling capabilities and constraint adaptability to encompass operational and strategic factors. Offered on-site optimization support across numerous bidding cycles, resulting in $30 million operational cost savings, noteworthy labor hour reduction, and heightened stability within the Walmart supply chain.\nTech Stack: Java, JavaScript | MIP, Heuristics\n\nData Scientist\n\nConstructed a column-generation-driven optimization engine in a rolling horizon framework, focusing on assigning drivers to tractors to optimize tractor utilization and reduce driver split-seat instances. Generated $4 million labor cost savings and $8 million operational cost savings annually through this approach.\nImplemented a column-generation-based optimization engine to estimate store-level customer purchase probability based on historical transaction data. Built a MIP engine to decide optimal offer set for each category at store level.\nMigrated legacy truckload optimization COBOL code to Java, reducing data processing time from 10 minutes to 10 seconds. Developed heuristic algorithms to solve instances with large number of orders, resulting in a daily reduction of 14 trucks.\nTech stack: Java, COBOL | Column Generation, MIP, Heuristics\n\nGlobal Business Process Intern\n\nContributed to the implementation and validation of next generation inventory optimization model for Walmart U.S., yielding an 8% improvement over the existing system in pilot store trials. Spearheaded the data platform migration from Teradata to Hadoop, implementing data ETL processes and Hive queries.\n\n\n\nPatents\n\n\nLoad Builder Optimizer using a Column Generation Engine\nKunlei Lian, Ming Ni, Mingang Fu\n\n\n2023\n\n\nThis patent presents a column generation-based optimization engine to solve shipment pickup and delivery problems. It aims to consolidate hundreds of thousands of shipments on a daily basis over Walmart’s vast inbound network and move them from their origins to their corresponding destinations while utilizing consolidation center capacities as much as possible to save transportation costs.\n\n\nSystems and Methods for Driver Scheduling\nKunlei Lian, Ming Ni, Mingang Fu\n\n\n2022\n\n\nThis patent introduces a column generation-based rolling horizon optimization engine that optimizes the assignment of drivers to tractors. This critical process significantly influences operational efficiency and costs within the Walmart private fleet. The solution is able to minimize the split-seats among drivers while maximizing tractor utilization.\n\n\nSystems and Methods for Safety Stock Settings Using a Parallel Processing Computing Architecture\nShuohao Wu, Richard Ulrich, Dong Xu, Jingying Zhang, Kunlei Lian, Clifford Bolinger, Jackie Guan\n\n\n2020\n\n\nThis patent features a Monte Carlo simulation-based stochastic optimization engine that employs GPU computing to optimize safety stock level settings across the chain, achieving reduced total inventory costs without impacting overall sales.\n\n\nPublications\n\nChang Lv, Chaoyong Zhang, Kunlei Lian, Yaping Ren and Leilei Meng.

Every once in a while, I would feel the site that I put up some time ago becomes too ugly to motivate me to update it. Since I have gradually used more Quarto to write my books and it also has the functionality to build website, I feel it’s time to yet again revamp my blog using Quarto. Hopefully, this is the last time."
